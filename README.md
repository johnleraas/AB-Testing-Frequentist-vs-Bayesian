# AB-Testing-Frequentist-vs-Bayesian

A/B Testing is an extremely common practice in web optimization, clinical trials, and a range of other applications. While the Frequentist Approach is the most commonly employed method in A/B testing, a Bayesian Approach offers many advantages including: requiring fewer observations, a more straightforward analysis, and more intuitive results.

This notebook directly compares the two methodologies (using conjugate priors to compute the posterior distribution):

This notebook utilizes MCMC Sampling (Markov Chain Monte Carlo Sampling) to
